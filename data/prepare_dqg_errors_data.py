This script loads the training split of the following datasets:

- musique
- breakhigh 
- 2wikimultihop

and samples N instances from each dataset

Each of these instances will be sent to GPT-4o to produce a rewrite
so that the text in the decomposed questions is different from the original, 
and at the same time introduce one or more faults into the decomposed questions.

The objective is to obtain multiple sets of synthetic DQG outputs (mimicking 
system outputs) which we can gather to use for ranking their quality.

MODEL = "gpt-4o-2024-08-06"
TEMPLATE = '''You are presented with a complex question (CQ) and an ordered sequence of subquestions (SQs). The SQs have been verified as being simpler decomposed questions of the CQ, i.e. when the SQs are correctly answered, the answer obtained for the final one will be the same as that for the CQ. The references to the answer of an earlier SQ is marked with a # followed by a number that is 1-indexed, e.g. in the SQ "SQ3 >> When was the company in #1 founded?", "#1" refers to the answer to the first SQ in the sequence; it is very important that you make sure to maintain this format when modifying the SQs. Your task is to paraphrase the SQs, and then introduce one or more faults into them as instructed. 

Complex question (CQ): {}
{}
Subquestions (SQs): {}
{}

Do the following steps: 
Step 1: Please paraphrase at least half of the SQs. When paraphrasing an SQ, try to give it a different syntactic structure. It is very important to keep the meaning of the original SQ intact. Do not add or remove any information from any of the SQs at this step.

Step 2: Please introduce the following faults into the SQs. It is very important: (i) To follow each of the instructions carefully. (ii) That you must not add or remove any SQs unless one of the instructions specifically asks you to do so. {}
{}

Step 3: Return the results in json_schema format with the following keys: (i) "modified_SQs" - is a list holding the SQs after the modifications, (ii) "index_modsSQs" - is a list holding the indices of the SQs that were modified, (iii) "mod_desc" - a list that corresponds with "index_modsSQs" with a short description (of 7 words or less) of what was modified for that SQ. Only return the modifed SQs, i.e. you MUST NOT include the prefix (e.g. "SQ1 >> ") from the input. Only return this json line, do not say anything else before or after it.'''
